excerpt: '**Background:** Transmission of Group B Streptococci (GBS) to newborns occurs in the perinatal period through direct channels in utero. GBS is one of the main bacteria responsible for neonatal infections. Objective: measure the prevalence of GBS genital carriage among pregnant women in the third trimester at the Sylvanus Olympio University Teaching Hospital. 
**Methods:** Vaginal swabs were obtained from 200 women between 34 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. The samples were seeded on sheep blood agar at 37o C for 16 to 18h. After incubation, suspected GBS colonies were identified by using a Latex Agglutination Test (LAT). Susceptibility test to antibiotics was performed by agar diffusion assay. 
**Results:** A total of 200 pregnant women with an average age of 28 years, were screened for GBS infection. The age group of 25-29 year olds was the highest (33.5%). The women as retailers were the majority (36.5%). Regarding the level of education, the percentage was 12.5%, 30.5%, 49% and 8% corresponding to uneducated, primary, secondary and university level respectively. The carriage rate was 2.5% (n = 5/200), 95% CI (0.3-4.7). No risk factors associated with the carriage rate identified. The isolated GBS strains were susceptible to penicillin G, erythromycin, co-amoxiclav and levofloxacin. The five GBS carriers were delivered by cesarean section for various reasons. 
**Conclusion:** Although a low carriage (2.5%) rate of GBS found in this study, a policy of systematic screening of pregnant women at least in the third trimester must be promoted.
