<cite>A cross-sectional study was conducted at the “Centre de l’Appui Psycho-Médico-Social (APMS)” which is a centre for Psychological and Medical Support in N'Djamena (Chad) from January to March 2014. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and viral load level and CD4 count in seventy-six (76) HIV-1 infected pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Urine culture and bacteria identification were performed by using a chromogenic culture medium (UriselectR4). T CD4+ lymphocytes count and viral load measurement were done respectively on PIMATM test and Abbott m2000 RealTime HIV-1. In this study, 25 (32.9%) pregnant women were carrying ASB and major bacteria; Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae known to cause neonatal meningitis to newborns were identified. Bacteria were isolated mainly in women with CD4 lymphocytes < 200 cells/mm3 (60%) (15/25) and a viral load > 3log (70%) (19/25). Besides the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV, which remains a goal, it is important to prevent also the transmission of other microorganisms causing neonatal infections. Our findings support the needs to do bacteriological analysis of urine in every HIV-in- fected pregnant woman at least in late pregnancy.</cite>
