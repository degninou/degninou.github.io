**Background:** Transmission of Group B Streptococci (GBS) to newborns occurs in the perinatal period through direct channels in utero. GBS is one of the main bacteria responsible for neonatal infections. Objective: measure the prevalence of GBS genital carriage among pregnant women in the third trimester at the Sylvanus Olympio University Teaching Hospital. 
**Methods:** Vaginal swabs were obtained from 200 women between 34 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. The samples were seeded on sheep blood agar at 37o C for 16 to 18h. After incubation, suspected GBS colonies were identified by using a Latex Agglutination Test (LAT). Susceptibility test to antibiotics was performed by agar diffusion assay. 

**Conclusion:** Although a low carriage (2.5%) rate of GBS found in this study, a policy of systematic screening of pregnant women at least in the third trimester must be promoted.
**Keywords:** pregnancy screening, group B streptococcus, women, Latex Agglutination Test
