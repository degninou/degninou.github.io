**Background:** Staphylococcal infections are managed by hygiene measures and usage of antibiotics. The  first-line  treatment  refers  to  beta-lactamins. However, the emergence of beta-lactamin  resis-tant  staphylococcal  strains  has  been  reported,  as  demonstrated  by  a  study  conducted  in  Lomé  University   Teaching   Hospital,   Bacteriology   Laboratory   (2001)   on   742   Staphylococcus   aureusstrains which  revealed  67.00%  of  them  where  methicillin  resistant.  In  this  setting  of  emergent  methicillin-resistant strains, the second-line treatments are prescribed by clinicians without anti-biograms.  Fluoroquinolones  are  the  first  preference  molecules  used  for  second-line  treatment  because of their efficacy and affordability. We want to contribute to setting monitoring and alert-making  tools  for  drug  prescribers.  Thus  we  conducted  this  study,  aiming  to  determine  the  fre-quency of S. aureusand coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains isolation in different typesof  biologic  samples,  and  to  investigate  the  link  between  methicillin  resistance  and  ciprofloxacin  resistance. 
**Methods:** We conducted this study from January 2006 through Jun 2010. The Microbi-ology  Laboratory  Service  collected  and  analyzed  samples  for  diagnostic  purpose  from  inpatients  and  outpatients  consulted  in  the  hospital.  We  collected  and  analyzed  de-identified  data  on  these  patients to form laboratory records. Bacteriological analyses in which ciprofloxacin have not been tested were excluded. 
**Results:** Over the 1108 staphylococal strains isolated from various biological samples processed, 751 were Staphylococcus aureus and 357 were coagulase-negative staphylococci. The strains sensitivity profile is for all isolates. The majority of germs were S. aureus and 20% of them were ciprofloxacin-resistant. The probability of a patient who has an infection caused by S. aureus increases his stay in high-risk settings such as intensive care unit, surgical intervention, extended hospitalization, use of a catheter. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the risk of multidrug-resistant strains. 
**Conclusion:** This study highlights the recurring issue of over consumption of antibiotics in nowadays medical treatments. There is a need to raise awareness about the rational use of antibiotics in general and fluoroquinolones particularly.
