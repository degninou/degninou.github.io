excerpt: '**Background:** HIV infection is a global health concern and the epidemic is particularly serious in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding HIV-related knowledge, attitude and behavior is a key element for prevention programs. Because of rural-urban variations in social and economic factors, this study was conducted to assess urban-rural disparities in HIV-related knowledge, attitude and behavior in Burkina Faso.
**Methods:** This study is based on a nationally representative data from the 2010 Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey. Odds ratios from the logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between HIV-related knowledge, attitude and behaviors with residence (urban /rural).
**Results:** More rural residents were uneducated (82.13%), illiterates (80.13%), and poor (94.54%) compared to urban residents with values of 17.87%, 19.87% and 5.45%, respectively. The prevalence of HIV residents was significantly lower among rural residents (0.65%) as compared with urban residents (1.88%). Rural residents compared to urban residents were more likely to have incomplete knowledge or inappropriate HIV-related attitude and behavior: incomplete knowledge about HIV (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 3.15 – 3.63), incomplete knowledge of MTCT prevention methods (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.88 – 2.16), non-accepting attitude toward people living with HIV (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 2.78 – 3.26), unfavorable for youth education on condom use (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.41 – 1.65), first sex before 15 years old (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.96 – 1.21), multiple sex partnership among men (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.33 – 1.75), don’t know any source of condoms (OR = 3.02, 95% CI 2.67 – 3.42) and don’t know any source of female condoms (OR = 3.27 95% CI 3.04 – 3.51).
**Conclusion:** Compared to urban residents, Burkina Faso rural residents tend to have limited HIV knowledge, limited access to condom. Also, compared to urban residents, more Burkina Faso rural residents had inappropriate HIV attitude and behavior. However, the HIV prevalence was lower among rural residents. The disparities between urban and rural residents of Burkina Faso with respect to HIV knowledge, attitude and behaviors calls for appropriate public health measures to increase HIV awareness in rural areas.'
