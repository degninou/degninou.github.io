16-12-2014	Ciprofloxacin Sensitivity of Staphylococcus Strains Isolated at the Sylvanus Olympio University Hospital, Togo	Pharmacology & Pharmacy	"**Background:** Staphylococcal infections are managed by hygiene measures and usage of antibiotics. The  first-line  treatment  refers  to  beta-lactamins. However, the emergence of beta-lactamin  resis-tant  staphylococcal  strains  has  been  reported,  as  demonstrated  by  a  study  conducted  in  Lomé  University   Teaching   Hospital,   Bacteriology   Laboratory   (2001)   on   742   Staphylococcus   aureusstrains which  revealed  67.00%  of  them  where  methicillin  resistant.  In  this  setting  of  emergent  methicillin-resistant strains, the second-line treatments are prescribed by clinicians without anti-biograms.  Fluoroquinolones  are  the  first  preference  molecules  used  for  second-line  treatment  because of their efficacy and affordability. We want to contribute to setting monitoring and alert-making  tools  for  drug  prescribers.  Thus  we  conducted  this  study,  aiming  to  determine  the  fre-quency of S. aureusand coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains isolation in different typesof  biologic  samples,  and  to  investigate  the  link  between  methicillin  resistance  and  ciprofloxacin  resistance. 
**Methods:** We conducted this study from January 2006 through Jun 2010. The Microbi-ology  Laboratory  Service  collected  and  analyzed  samples  for  diagnostic  purpose  from  inpatients  and  outpatients  consulted  in  the  hospital.  We  collected  and  analyzed  de-identified  data  on  these  patients to form laboratory records. Bacteriological analyses in which ciprofloxacin have not been tested were excluded. 
**Results:** Over the 1108 staphylococal strains isolated from various biological samples processed, 751 were Staphylococcus aureus and 357 were coagulase-negative staphylococci. The strains sensitivity profile is for all isolates. The majority of germs were S. aureus and 20% of them were ciprofloxacin-resistant. The probability of a patient who has an infection caused by S. aureus increases his stay in high-risk settings such as intensive care unit, surgical intervention, extended hospitalization, use of a catheter. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the risk of multidrug-resistant strains. 
**Conclusion:** This study highlights the recurring issue of over consumption of antibiotics in nowadays medical treatments. There is a need to raise awareness about the rational use of antibiotics in general and fluoroquinolones particularly.

2015-12-08	Correlation between Asymptomatic Bacteriuria and HIV-1 Viral Load Level and CD4 Count in Pregnant Women on Antiretroviral Therapy in N’djamena (Chad)	 World Journal of AIDS	"<cite>A cross-sectional study was conducted at the “Centre de l’Appui Psycho-Médico-Social (APMS)” which is a centre for Psychological and Medical Support in N'Djamena (Chad) from January to March 2014. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and viral load level and CD4 count in seventy-six (76) HIV-1 infected pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Urine culture and bacteria identification were performed by using a chromogenic culture medium (UriselectR4). T CD4+ lymphocytes count and viral load measurement were done respectively on PIMATM test and Abbott m2000 RealTime HIV-1. In this study, 25 (32.9%) pregnant women were carrying ASB and major bacteria; Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae known to cause neonatal meningitis to newborns were identified. Bacteria were isolated mainly in women with CD4 lymphocytes < 200 cells/mm3 (60%) (15/25) and a viral load > 3log (70%) (19/25). Besides the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV, which remains a goal, it is important to prevent also the transmission of other microorganisms causing neonatal infections. Our findings support the needs to do bacteriological analysis of urine in every HIV-in- fected pregnant woman at least in late pregnancy.</cite>

20-04-2015	Urban-rural disparities in HIV related knowledge, behavior and attitude in Burkina Faso: Evidence from Burkina Faso attitude in Burkina Faso: Evidence from Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey 2010 Demographic and Health Survey 2010	 ScholarWorks,  Georgia State University	"**Background:** HIV infection is a global health concern and the epidemic is particularly serious in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding HIV-related knowledge, attitude and behavior is a key element for prevention programs. Because of rural-urban variations in social and economic factors, this study was conducted to assess urban-rural disparities in HIV-related knowledge, attitude and behavior in Burkina Faso.
**Methods:** This study is based on a nationally representative data from the 2010 Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey. Odds ratios from the logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between HIV-related knowledge, attitude and behaviors with residence (urban /rural).
**Results:** More rural residents were uneducated (82.13%), illiterates (80.13%), and poor (94.54%) compared to urban residents with values of 17.87%, 19.87% and 5.45%, respectively. The prevalence of HIV residents was significantly lower among rural residents (0.65%) as compared with urban residents (1.88%). Rural residents compared to urban residents were more likely to have incomplete knowledge or inappropriate HIV-related attitude and behavior: incomplete knowledge about HIV (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 3.15 – 3.63), incomplete knowledge of MTCT prevention methods (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.88 – 2.16), non-accepting attitude toward people living with HIV (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 2.78 – 3.26), unfavorable for youth education on condom use (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.41 – 1.65), first sex before 15 years old (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.96 – 1.21), multiple sex partnership among men (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.33 – 1.75), don’t know any source of condoms (OR = 3.02, 95% CI 2.67 – 3.42) and don’t know any source of female condoms (OR = 3.27 95% CI 3.04 – 3.51).
**Conclusion:** Compared to urban residents, Burkina Faso rural residents tend to have limited HIV knowledge, limited access to condom. Also, compared to urban residents, more Burkina Faso rural residents had inappropriate HIV attitude and behavior. However, the HIV prevalence was lower among rural residents. The disparities between urban and rural residents of Burkina Faso with respect to HIV knowledge, attitude and behaviors calls for appropriate public health measures to increase HIV awareness in rural areas."

25-02-2015	 Group B Streptococcal Carriage Rate in Vagina of Pregnant Women in Third Trimester in Lomé, Togo	 World Journal of Preventive Medicine	"**Background:** Transmission of Group B Streptococci (GBS) to newborns occurs in the perinatal period through direct channels in utero. GBS is one of the main bacteria responsible for neonatal infections. Objective: measure the prevalence of GBS genital carriage among pregnant women in the third trimester at the Sylvanus Olympio University Teaching Hospital. 
**Methods:** Vaginal swabs were obtained from 200 women between 34 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. The samples were seeded on sheep blood agar at 37o C for 16 to 18h. After incubation, suspected GBS colonies were identified by using a Latex Agglutination Test (LAT). Susceptibility test to antibiotics was performed by agar diffusion assay. 
**Results:** A total of 200 pregnant women with an average age of 28 years, were screened for GBS infection. The age group of 25-29 year olds was the highest (33.5%). The women as retailers were the majority (36.5%). Regarding the level of education, the percentage was 12.5%, 30.5%, 49% and 8% corresponding to uneducated, primary, secondary and university level respectively. The carriage rate was 2.5% (n = 5/200), 95% CI (0.3-4.7). No risk factors associated with the carriage rate identified. The isolated GBS strains were susceptible to penicillin G, erythromycin, co-amoxiclav and levofloxacin. The five GBS carriers were delivered by cesarean section for various reasons. 
**Conclusion:** Although a low carriage (2.5%) rate of GBS found in this study, a policy of systematic screening of pregnant women at least in the third trimester must be promoted.

22-01-2016	 An analysis of global youth tobacco survey for developing a comprehensive national smoking policy in Timor-Leste	 BMC Public Health	"**Background:** Smoking is a global public health concern. Timor-Leste is facing a rapidly growing epidemic of tobacco use. The trend of smoking in Timor-Leste seems to be increasing and the magnitude of the problem affects people who smoke before reaching adulthood. One of the factors implicated in the continuously rising trend of smoking among young people in Timor-Leste is clearly due to unavailability of restrictive laws and regulations. Therefore, our study sought to analyze available dataset from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) for developing a comprehensive national smoking policy in order to lower smoking risks among young people in Timor-Leste.
**Methods:** We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2009 GYTS in Timor-Leste. The 2009 GYTS assessed 1657 in-school students aged 13–15 years for current smoking prevalence and determinants of tobacco use. We used IBM SPSS version 21 software to analyze the data. Frequency analyses were computed to identify demographic characteristics of study participants. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between each demographic characteristic as well as each independent variable and the outcome of being current smokers.
**Results:** Out of 1657 in-school students, 51 % were of ages less than 15; 53 % were girls; and 45 % were in grade 2. Prevalence of current cigarette smoking was found to be 51 %. The prevalence of current smoking among in-school students increased with ages (from 46 % in less than 15 to 57 % in 15 plus). Boys were more likely to be smokers than girls (59 % versus 28 %). Significant factors positively associated with current smoking included parental smoking; closed-peer smoking; number of days people smoked in the house; having family discussion about harmful effects of smoking; being smoking in areas such as school, public places and home; and having seen cigarette advertisements on billboard.
**Conclusion:** Timor-Leste has higher prevalence of cigarette smoking among minors, especially among boys. Our analysis provides evidence-based information for developing comprehensive tobacco control programs - both education and policy interventions to reduce smoking rate among young people in Timor-Leste.

23-01-2018	 Molecular xenomonitoring for post-validation surveillance of lymphatic filariasis in Togo: no evidence for active transmission	Parasites & Vectors	"**Background:** Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne filarial disease targeted for elimination by the year 2020. The Republic of Togo undertook mass treatment of entire endemic communities from 2000 to 2009 to eliminate the transmission of the disease and is currently the first sub-Saharan African country to be validated by WHO for the elimination of LF as a public health problem. However, post-validation surveillance activities are required to ensure the gains achieved are sustained. This survey assessed the mosquito vectors of the disease and determined the presence of infection in these vectors, testing the hypothesis that transmission has already been interrupted in Togo.
**Methods:** Mosquitoes were collected from 37 villages located in three districts in one of four evaluation units in the country. In each district, 30 villages were selected based on probability proportionate to size; eight villages (including one of the 30 villages already selected) where microfilaremia-positive cases had been identified during post-treatment surveillance activities were intentionally sampled. Mosquitoes were collected using pyrethrum spray collections (PSC) in households randomly selected in all villages for five months. In the purposefully selected communities, mosquitoes were also collected using human landing collections (HLC) and exit traps (ET). Collected mosquitoes were identified morphologically, and the identification of Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in the mosquitoes was based on the pool screening method, using the LAMP assay.
**Results:** A total of 15,539 mosquitoes were collected during the study. Anopheles gambiae (72.6%) was the predominant LF vector collected using PSC. Pool screen analysis of 9191 An. gambiae in 629 pools revealed no mosquitoes infected with W. bancrofti (0%; CI: 0–0.021).
**Conclusion:** These results confirm the findings of epidemiological transmission assessment surveys conductedin 2012 and 2015, which demonstrated the absence of LF transmission in Togo. The challenges of implementingmolecular xenomonitoring are further discussed.

22-06-2016	 Therapeutic efficacy trial of artemisinin-based combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria and investigation of mutations in k13 propeller domain in Togo, 2012–2013	 Malaria Journal	"**Background:** Since 2005, the Togo National Malaria Control Programme has recommended two different formulations of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), artesunate–amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL), for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Regular efficacy monitoring of these two combinations is conducted every 2 or 3 years. This paper reports the latest efficacy assessment results and the investigation of mutations in the k13 propeller domain.
**Methods:** The study was conducted in 2012–2013 on three sentinel sites of Togo (Lomé, Sokodé and Niamtougou). Children aged 6–59 months, who were symptomatically infected with Plasmodium falciparum, were treated with either AL (Coartem®, Novartis Pharma, Switzerland) or ASAQ (Co-Arsucam®, Sanofi Aventis, France). The WHO standard protocol for anti-malarial treatment evaluation was used. The primary end-point was 28-day adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), corrected to exclude reinfection using polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) genotyping.
**Results:** A total of 523 children were included in the study. PCR-corrected ACPR was 96.3–100 % for ASAQ and 97–100 % for AL across the three study sites. Adverse events were negligible: 0–4.8 % across all sites, for both artemisinin-based combinations. Upon investigation of mutations in the k13 propeller domain, only 9 (1.8 %) mutations were reported, three in each site. All mutant parasites were cleared before day 3. All day 3 positive patients were infected with k13 wild type parasites.
**Conclusion:** The efficacy of AL and ASAQ remains high in Togo, and both drugs are well tolerated. ASAQ and AL would be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Togo.

16-04-2018	 Surveillance for lymphatic filariasis after stopping mass drug administration in endemic districts of Togo, 2010–2015	 Parasites & Vectors	"**Background:** Togo is a country previously endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF). In 2010, following nine years of mass drug administration (MDA) for LF, the country established a post-treatment surveillance (PTS) system. We present here the results of these PTS activities, carried out from 2010 to 2015, as well as the findings of follow-up investigations in 2016 to confirm the absence of infection in previously infected individuals.
**Methods:** The routine surveillance established in 2010 consisted of a network of 47 laboratories, which searched for Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaria on nocturnal blood smears collected for malaria diagnosis and an additional network of 20 peripheral health facilities, which collected dried blood spots and tested them for Og4C3 antigen. Two transmission assessment surveys (TAS) were also undertaken, as recommended by WHO, in 2012 and 2015. Any positive case identified through any surveillance activity was immediately retested by nocturnal smear and confirmed cases were immediately investigated by screening family members and neighboring household members. In 2016, 32 of the 40 positive cases detected during TAS or laboratory and health facility network activities were traced and whether confirmed positive by nocturnal smear or not were tested again simultaneously by filariasis test strip (FTS), Og4C3 and a nocturnal blood smear to rule out any active infection.
**Results:** From 2010 to 2015, the laboratory network identified one microfilaria-positive individual (0.0% of 26,584 persons tested) and the peripheral health facility network detected 19 Og4C3-positive individuals (0.28% of 6788 persons tested). All 19 Og4C3 cases were negative for microfilaremia by nocturnal blood smear. In the 2012 and 2015 TAS, thirteen and six ICT/FTS positive cases, respectively, were identified, which were significantly below the critical cut-off (18–20 cases) across all evaluation units. Three of the six ICT/FTS-positive cases from the 2015 TAS were positive by nocturnal smear; immediate investigation identified one additional microfilaria-positive individual. Epidemiological investigation revealed that four of the five cases of microfilaremia were imported from another country in the region. In 2016, 32 of the 40 positive cases detected by at least one test during all surveillance activities were traced: four (12.5%) individuals were still positive by FTS but all 32 individuals were negative for microfilaremia and Og4C3 antigen.
**Conclusion:** The results of post-treatment surveillance in Togo have demonstrated that W. bancrofti filariasis is no longer of public health concern in Togo, more than six years after stopping MDA. Every possible effort should be made to maintain surveillance in order to promptly detect any resurgence and preserve this achievement.
